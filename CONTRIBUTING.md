# Contributing

Thanks for your interest!

## Dev setup

```bash
npm i
npm run dev -- --help
```

## Commit style

- Conventional commits (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`).
- Keep PRs small and focused. Only one commit per PR.

## Running

- `npm run dev` for development
- `npm run build` then `node dist/index.js ...` for a release-like run

## Issues & PRs

- For **bugs**, include the exact command, output, and environment.
- For **features**, describe the use case and expected output JSON/CSV fields.
- Add tests if you introduce logic; small PRs welcome.
